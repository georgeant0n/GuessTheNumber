# 🎮 Guess The Number

📖 About This Project

This is a simple 'Guess the Number' project where the computer "thinks" of a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what it is. The game provides feedback ('Too high' or 'Too low') and limits the number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.

Two Difficulty Levels:

Easy: 10 attempts to guess.

Hard: 5 attempts to guess.

Instant Feedback: Get "Too high" or "Too low" feedback after each guess.

Attempt Tracking: The game displays how many attempts you have remaining.

ASCII Logo: Displays a cool logo at the start of the game (using the art library).
